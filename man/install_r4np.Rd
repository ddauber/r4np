\description{
Install R packages relevant for the book 'R for Non-Programmers: A Guide for Social Scientists'.
}
\details{
Installs the following R packages at once:
\itemize{
 \item{broom: }{Turns output from functions into tibbles.}
 \item{car: }{Interpret regression results}
 \item{correlation: }{Lightweight package for computing different kinds of
                      correlations, such as partial correlations, Bayesian
                      correlations, multilevel correlations, polychoric correlations,
                      biweight correlations, distance correlations and more.}
 \item{effectsize: }{Provide utilities to work with indices of effect size and
                     standardized parameters for a wide variety of models,
                     allowing computation of and conversion between indices such as Cohen's d,
                     r, odds, etc.}
 \item{exact2x2: }{Provides a function to compute the exact McNemar Test.}
 \item{ggdist: }{ggplot2 extension to plot uncertainty and frequencies.}
 \item{ggforce: }{ggplot2 extension to plot even more geoms.}
 \item{ggmosaic: }{Creates mosiac plots with ggplot2. Useful when visualising contingency tables}
 \item{ggraph: }{Used to build network graphs}
 \item{ggridges: }{ggplot2 extension to build ridge plots}
 \item{janitor: }{The main janitor functions can: perfectly f
                  ormat data.frame column names; provide quick
                  counts of variable combinations (i.e., frequency
                  tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records.}
 \item{jtools: }{This is a collection of tools that the author (Jacob) has written for
                 the purpose of more efficiently understanding and sharing the results
                 of (primarily) regression analyses.}
 \item{lavaan: }{Fit a variety of latent variable models, including confirmatory factor analysis,
                 structural equation modeling and latent growth curve models.}
 \item{igraph: }{Used in combination with ggraph to create network plots}
 \item{mice: }{Multiple imputation using Fully Conditional Specification (FCS)
              implemented by the MICE algorithm as described in Van Buuren and
              Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011).}
 \item{mi: }{Provides functions for data manipulation, imputing missing values
             in an approximate Bayesian framework, diagnostics of the models used
             to generate the imputations, etc.}
 \item{modelr: }{Build pipefriendly operations to model data.}
 \item{naniar: }{Provides data structures and functions that
                 facilitate the plotting of missing values and examination
                 of imputations.}
 \item{parameters: }{Returns parameters from regression models.}
 \item{patchwork: }{Combine different ggplots into one plot.}
 \item{performance: }{Returns performance indices for regression models}
 \item{psych: }{A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory
                and experimental psychology.}
 \item{pwr: }{Compute the statistical power of different analytical approaches}
 \item{rcompanion: }{Additional functions, such as for effect sizes.}
 \item{rstatix: }{A pipe-friendly way of computing various common statistics.}
 \item{scales: }{Useful functions to format ggplot axes.}
 \item{see: }{Enables visualising output from easystats packages.}
 \item{simputation: }{Offer imputation methods for missing data.}
 \item{skimr: }{A simple to use summary function that can be used with pipes
                and displays nicely in the console.}
 \item{tidyverse: }{Install the core tidyverse packages.}
 \item{wesanderson: }{Colour palettes inspired by Wes Anderson movies for ggplot2}
 \item{wordcloud: }{Generates word clouds from text data.}
