\description{
Install R packages relevant for the book 'R for Non-Programmers: A Guide for Social Scientists'.
}
\details{
Installs the following R packages at once:
\itemize{
 \item{tidyverse: }{Install the core tidyverse packages.}
 \item{janitor: }{The main janitor functions can: perfectly f
                  ormat data.frame column names; provide quick
                  counts of variable combinations (i.e., frequency
                  tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records.}
 \item{naniar: }{Provides data structures and functions that
                 facilitate the plotting of missing values and examination
                 of imputations.}
 \item{mice: }{Multiple imputation using Fully Conditional Specification (FCS)
              implemented by the MICE algorithm as described in Van Buuren and
              Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011)}
 \item{mi: }{Provides functions for data manipulation, imputing missing values
             in an approximate Bayesian framework, diagnostics of the models used
             to generate the imputations, etc.}
 \item{psych: }{A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory
                and experimental psychology.}
 \item{skimr: }{A simple to use summary function that can be used with pipes
                and displays nicely in the console.}
 \item{correlation: }{Lightweight package for computing different kinds of
                      correlations, such as partial correlations, Bayesian
                      correlations, multilevel correlations, polychoric correlations,
                      biweight correlations, distance correlations and more.}
 \item{rcompanion: }{Additional functions, such as for effect sizes.}
 \item{effectsize: }{Provide utilities to work with indices of effect size and
                     standardized parameters for a wide variety of models,
                     allowing computation of and conversion between indices such as Cohen's d,
                     r, odds, etc.}
 \item{car: }{Interpret regression results}
 \item{FSA: }{NOT SURE}
 \item{jtools: }{This is a collection of tools that the author (Jacob) has written for
                 the purpose of more efficiently understanding and sharing the results
                 of (primarily) regression analyses. }
